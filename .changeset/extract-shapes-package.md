Extract the pure Shapes library core (parser, adapters, registry, installer, toml, capabilities, request-builders, shell-parser, types, audit, http, config) from `@openape/apes` into a new `@openape/shapes` package. Grant-orchestration and CLI glue stay in apes and consume the package. No behaviour change.
